3. You get to see your own ProductID, that is what you will copy and paste as a value to the variable in line 7 of the App.js file.

4. You give your application a Title.

5. At the left hand side of the screen, you will see some options. The "Users" there, allows you to create a/ some users that can have access to the real application, it is just as signing them up manually.

6. The "Chats" helps users to create chat that you will use to communicate with your friend or friends, depending on the number of people you are putting/inviting in the chat. Although, this can be done from the application itself. When you access the application, at the upper-left, you get to see a space, there, you can create your chat there and go to the right side of your screen, you will see "People", click on it, it brings out the users that can access the application(those who have signed up). You can click on anyone/people you want to be in the chat with you for a conversation.
